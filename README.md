# Christopher Kokoski's Cybersecurity Portfolio

This portfolio contains hands-on projects in vulnerability analysis, system hardening, and threat mitigation. I am building a foundation in defensive security (Blue Team) to become a more effective offensive operator (Red Teamer). This repository serves as a living document of my skills, methodologies, and progress.

## Portfolio Projects
Below is a collection of projects demonstrating my practical, hands-on cybersecurity skills.

### Defense (Blue Team) & System Hardening

#### [Project 1: Live Web Application Security Audit & Hardening](blue-team/01-webapp-audit/README.md)
**Description:** Performed a full "Scan -> Remediate -> Verify" lifecycle audit on a live web server. Used Nmap and Qualys SSL Labs to identify vulnerabilities, analyzed results, and diagnosed a complex server misconfiguration that was not apparent to the hosting provider's support team.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
* Vulnerability Management
* Vendor Communication
* Root Cause Analysis
* TLS/SSL Hardening
* Nmap
* Qualys SSL Labs

#### [Project 2: Web Application Vulnerability Scan & Remediation](blue-team/02-webapp-vulnerability-scan/README.md)

**Description:** Conducted a dynamic application security test (DAST) using OWASP ZAP. Identified a missing Content Security Policy (CSP) header, troubleshooted WAF and plugin blocks, and remediated the finding by deploying a custom PHP snippet.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
* DAST Scanning (OWASP ZAP)
* Vulnerability Analysis
* WAF Evasion
* Technical Remediation (PHP)
* Verification

### Offense (Red Team) & Penetration Testing

#### [Project 3: Network Penetration Test](Project-3-Network-Penetration-Test.md)

**Description:** Conducted a network penetration test against a Metasploitable2 server. Used Nmap for reconnaissance to identify a vulnerable FTP service and exploited it with the Metasploit Framework to gain root-level system access.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Penetration Testing Methodology
- Reconnaissance (Nmap)
- Vulnerability Identification
- Exploitation (Metasploit)
- Post-Exploitation

*(More projects, including offensive security exercises, will be added here as they are completed.)*
